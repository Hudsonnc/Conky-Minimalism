# Conky-Minimalism
Minor variation of simple conky config by [NoTranslation](https://github.com/NoTranslation/Conky-Minimalism). A few minor visual tweaks as well as removing cpu core temps and replacing them with (nvidia) GPU temp and usage. Also replaced the Arch logo with the Ubuntu logo because I use Ubuntu :P

**Requires:**
  * ttf-robot
  * Conky with lua support
  * lm-sensors
  * nvidia-smi

## Installation
  1. Extract the zip file
